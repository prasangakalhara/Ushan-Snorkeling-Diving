      <p class="my-2" style="line-height: 2;">The Bogoda wooden bridge, nestled in the picturesque Badulla district near the town of Hali Ella, stands as a remarkable relic of the past. Considered the oldest wooden bridge in Sri Lanka, it dates back to the Dambadeniya kingdom era (1220–1345 AD). What sets this bridge apart is its construction entirely without the use of iron nails, showcasing the ingenious craftsmanship of its creators. <br><br>Perched above the flowing waters of the Loggal Oya, adjacent to the Bogoda Temple, this bridge holds historical significance. Legend has it that it once formed part of the old Badulla – Kandy road, traversed by the early Sinhalese kingdom. A fascinating addition to the temple premises is an ancient tunnel, though today it remains visible for only a few meters. According to local villagers, the other end of the tunnel can be glimpsed approximately 12 kilometers away.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
  
      <h3 class="font-weight-bold text-dark">Location and Access</h3>
      <p class="my-2" style="line-height: 2;">Reaching Bogoda is a breeze, as it is conveniently located near Badulla. Travelers can take the Badulla – Bandarawela highway, passing through Hali Ella until reaching Ketawela. From there, a worn-out access road near Jagula leads to the magnificent Bogoda Temple and its splendid wooden bridge. The journey along this stretch spans about 2 miles, with a total distance of approximately 12 miles from Badulla. Along the way, be enchanted by the gentle swaying of coconut and areca palms, bestowing a refreshing mountain breeze.</p>

      <br>
  
      <h3 class="font-weight-bold text-dark">Bogoda Temple</h3>
      <p class="my-2" style="line-height: 2;">At the heart of Bogoda lies the Bogoda Raja Maha Viharaya, a rock cave hermitage that houses a treasure trove of ancient artifacts. Delight in the presence of a reclining Buddha statue, exquisite mural paintings, and an intriguing device within its walls. The rock cave's pinnacle showcases meticulously crafted drip ledges adorned with Brahmi characters, offering a glimpse into the temple's historical significance. Marvel at the captivating mural paintings depicting scenes from Buddhist traditions and culture, a testament to the artistic heritage of the region. As you enter the temple, you'll be greeted by an ornamental door frame intricately carved with designs, while weathered statues serve as wooden molds for casting Buddha statues.</p>
      
      <br>    

      <br>
  
      <h3 class="font-weight-bold text-dark">Wooden Bridge</h3>
      <p class="my-2" style="line-height: 2;">Adjacent to the temple premises, Gallanda Oya flows melodiously over rocks and boulders, forming serene rock pools with clear, cold waters. Across this picturesque Gallanda Oya, the Bogoda wooden bridge spans, its roof adorned with flat tiles reminiscent of the renowned Kandyan architecture. From a distance, the wooden bridge resembles a charming cottage, paying homage to the architectural design of the Kandyan era. Remarkably, this timber structure has been built without any nails, showcasing the ingenuity and skill of its creators.</p>
      
      <br>    

      <br>
  
      <h3 class="font-weight-bold text-dark">Legends and Myths</h3>
      <p class="my-2" style="line-height: 2;">Immersed in captivating legends passed down through generations, the Bogoda wooden bridge carries an intriguing origin story. One tale recounts how pilgrims from nearby villages, such as Nillandahinna, Uda Pusselawa, Godamane, and Kandaketiya, used to traverse treacherous trails to Mahiyangane and Kandy, risking the crossing of the Gallanda Oya without a bridge or footbridge. In their devotion, these villagers made a vow to God Vishnu, pleading for a bridge to be built. Miraculously, a massive tree felled in the Narangala hill range for this purpose found its way to a village called Lunugalla. To everyone's astonishment, the tree trunk appeared near Gallanda Oya the following day. Thus, the construction of the epic wooden bridge with its roof paved with flat tiles began, entwined with this curious and mythical origin story.</p>
      
      <br>    

      <br>
  
      <h3 class="font-weight-bold text-dark">Transformation in the Kandyan Period</h3>
      <p class="my-2" style="line-height: 2;">During the reign of the last King of Kandy, Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe, the Bogoda wooden bridge underwent significant enhancements. The original footbridge, believed to date back to the Dambadeniya period (circa 1220-1283 AD), was transformed into its present state. Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe's additions included railings, wooden planks, and a roof clad with flat tiles, solidifying its connection to the Kandyan period. Today, the bridge stretches approximately 40 feet and stands on concrete abutments, replacing the original wooden pillars that rested on rock slabs. As you step onto the bridge through the entrance carved into a rock outcrop, you'll be able to appreciate its wooden floor and railings supported by dwarfed wooden pillars.</p>

      <br>
  
      <h3 class="font-weight-bold text-dark">Temple Premises and Past Glimpses</h3>
      <p class="my-2" style="line-height: 2;">Below the rock temple and the wooden bridge, the temple premises offer a tranquil haven for resident priests. Nestled amidst groves of coconut and areca palms, this serene atmosphere provides an ideal space for contemplation and spiritual practice. The rock temple's origins can be traced back to Valagamba's exile in the 1st century B.C. Seeking refuge in the rock caves nestled within the forests, Valagamba is attributed to the construction of the temple and the remarkable 18-foot reclining Buddha statue. Legends abound about a tunnel beneath the temple, believed to extend to the Narangala hill range. One story tells of a Buddhist priest who followed a dog chasing an animal, only to discover the tunnel's end near Narangala.

        <br><br>Ancient Brahmi inscriptions adorn the walls deep within the temple, offering glimpses into the past. Although only partially deciphered, these inscriptions mention Brammadatta, Tissa's son, who was entrusted with the temple and its sacredness, a gift to the four corners of Lanka. This historical connection underscores the significance of the Bogoda wooden bridge and temple, symbolizing their importance throughout the ages.
        
        <br><br>Under the custodianship of the Archaeological Department, the Bogoda wooden bridge is meticulously preserved, ensuring its legacy for generations to come. The bridge stands as a testament to the remarkable craftsmanship and architectural prowess of the past. Its existence today is a tribute to those who recognize the value of preserving Sri Lanka's cultural heritage.
